I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego working with Sorin Lerner (but I work remotely from NYC). In May 2023, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, where I worked with Yuriy Brun in the Laboratory for Software Engineering Research (LASER). In May 2017, I received a BS in Math and Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in leveraging AI for theorem proving as a playground for exploring how AI can reason better, and in turn, how humans can use AI to reason better themselves in a variety of domains. I am an interdisciplinary researcher, working at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and programming languages. So far, I have worked on creating tools to automatically generate proofs in proof assistants, such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and Lean.
