I am an incoming (Fall 2025) Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego advised by Sorin Lerner. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, where I was advised by Yuriy Brun in the Laboratory for Software Engineering Research (LASER). I received a BS in Math and Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in leveraging AI for theorem proving as a playground for exploring how AI can reason better, and in turn, how humans can use AI to reason better themselves in a variety of domains. 

I am an interdisciplinary researcher, working at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and programming languages. So far, I have worked on creating tools to automatically generate proofs in proof assistants, such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and Lean.  

Overall, my research interests are quite broad: AI for SE/PL and quantitative reasoning.  

If you're interested in working with me (prospective PhD student, current PhD/masters/undergrad student at Rutgers, or just wanting to collaborate) please reach out via email.
